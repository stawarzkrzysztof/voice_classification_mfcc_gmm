# Voice Classification using MFCC and Gaussian Mixture Models  
  
## About
This is one of my first self-made project. The script trains on `.wav` recordings and then classifies them. 
  
## External Packages  
The following packages are required for script to work:
```text
Name                Version
python              3.8.16
numpy               1.24.2
librosa             0.10.0.post2
scikit-learn        1.2.2
pandas              1.2.5
matplotlib-base     3.7.1
matplotlib-inline   0.1.6
seaborn             0.12.2
```  
Note: These are version I used while coding. Thus, it is possible that any version higher that mentioned above will work as well.
  
## How to run it?
1. Download the code or clone the repository  
2. Open the `voice_classic.py` script in your IDE.
